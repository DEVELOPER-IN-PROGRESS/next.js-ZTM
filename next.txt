just some of my random NOTEs regarding next.js 

in the pages/ directory every route name created from '/' will have the name of the .js file index.js being an exception . Even though Home component is 
exported out from index this still gets the default root . Back in react ecosystem we had to install react router and specify the routes separately , 
with next.js we have coomponent filename based routing .
_app.js is the main entry point to our App  we can add any component in this file and present it throughout the app .  
api/  directory allows you to write backend code alongside front end which is great for most part 
public/ directory is for storing the static files like images icons etc 
  styles/ directory contains the  global styles or the styles for individual component which is similar to the scoped styles present in vue 

Css modules are provided by next.js out of the box which will have .module.css file  which will be scoped to that particulAr component so we can use the same class 
over and over without affecting each other . Under the hood it works by generating dynamic class names to each component so there will be no naming conflict


Heading over to the 'head' component provided by nextjs which allows you to modify head part of every page within the page itself

Routing:: just like react-router uses the History API provided by the browser under the hood to make it more accessible for us . unlike the react router 
there are 3 ways of routing in next.js 
 1)index based : i.e  making a separate file for routing  .For this to happen the page must be a  React component and it should be exported by default 
 2) Nested route : routes within the index
 3) Dynamic routing : dynamically generated routes from a route  if we use [<any name>].js  file we have a dynamic route  


Link component : inorder to route to various pages we can use native <a> tag provided by the browser . when we use this however there will be a page refresh 
but with next Link component there is no page refresh however   <Link><a>text</a></Link>

Image component is an extension of <img> component with lots of features like image resizing according to viewport width .
The Head component used in _discover.js is different from what nextjs provides for us 
<link rel="preload" as="font" href="path" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
